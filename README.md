# Capstone---Ecommerce---Rafael-Arjay-Malayba

Clickable prototype
  * A Clickable Prototype shows a visual representation of the user interface of a website or software application. Unlike static wireframes or mockups, it can show several states of the application - for example, a drop-down menu, or initially hidden additional information or fields may appear.
### Instructions:
  * 95% of the eCommerce front-end is working. The feature that is missing is edit & delete of categories.
  * This project has no backend coding yet, therefore pagination and other that need queries will not work. It is ideal to use MVC framework for its backend.
  * To test this project, the clickable-prototype folder should be placed in a localhost server, where the index.html list all links for all the pages of the eCommerce website./
